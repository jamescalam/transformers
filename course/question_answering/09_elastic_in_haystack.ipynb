Simple experiments showed that Galileo\\'s understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct.

Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it.
